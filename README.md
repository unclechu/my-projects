  An utility that read bare events from GNU/Linux device file descriptor of
  a keyboard and triggers fake X11 events, improves experience of using keyboard.
- [place-cursor-at](https://github.com/unclechu/place-cursor-at)  
  An utility for X11 that helps to move cursor using only keyboard
  (at least reduces mouse usage).
- [qm-interpolated-string](https://github.com/unclechu/haskell-qm-interpolated-string)  
  A library for Haskell that provides few Quasi-Quoters for building
  interpolated strings with free decorative alignment.
- [midi-trigger](https://github.com/metachronica/audio-dsp-midi-trigger)  
  An audio plug-in that generates MIDI notes by detecing peaks in audio signal.
- [bit-crusher](https://github.com/unclechu/lv2-ladspa-bit-crusher)  
  An audio plug-in that provides downsampling and decreasing of bit-depth.
- [radio-class](https://github.com/unclechu/py-radio-class)  
  Event-bus implementation inspired by
  [backbone.radio](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.radio).
